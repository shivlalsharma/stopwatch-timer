## Deployment

## Features
- **Start**: Starts the timer and begins counting milliseconds, seconds, and minutes.
- **Stop**: Pauses the timer at its current state.
- **Reset**: Resets the timer back to 00:00:00.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, making it mobile-friendly.
- **Dark Blue Theme**: The stopwatch has a dark blue background with a modern design.
- **Simple Interface**: Easy-to-use interface with clear button labels for Start, Stop, and Reset.

## Technology Used
- **HTML**: For the basic structure of the stopwatch and buttons.
- **CSS**: For styling the layout, making it responsive, and applying the design.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the stopwatch functionality (Start, Stop, Reset).

## How It Works
1. **Start**: Clicking the "Start" button begins the countdown. The time is displayed in the format `MM : SS : MS` (Minutes : Seconds : Milliseconds).
2. **Stop**: Clicking the "Stop" button pauses the timer at the current time.
3. **Reset**: Clicking the "Reset" button resets the timer to `00 : 00 : 00` and stops any ongoing countdown.
